	Go over the Basics of C++ Syntax (Personal Time)
	A lot of Python will Help with C++
	If i research a method not covered in class for use on an assignment, cite my source and don't just C/P it
	"Class (Private by Default)" and "Struct (Open by Default)" are very similar
	Do Hello World!!! program in C++ by Monday
	C++ programs are saved as a .cpp (.cpp is the source code, .exe is the compiled executable)
		C++ Programs are compiled into an executable file (instead of being Interpreted in Python)
	Look into installing "Bloodshed Dev C++" or "Geany" on my laptop

	ANY CHANGES TO A SOURCE CODE MUST THEN BE RE-COMPILED INTO A NEW .EXE
