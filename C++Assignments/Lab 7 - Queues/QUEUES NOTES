Queues - homogenous data structure where you add at the end and remove from the front

FIFO - first in, first out
LILO - last in, last out

represent a Queue horizontally - front -> back
	enque/add/insert/addQueue - add to a queue (back/end)
	deque/remove/rem/del/deleteQueue - remove from a queue (front)
	
Array-Based CIRCULAR queues
	deletion would be handled by shifting first to the next index in line
		[2]->[8]->[4]
		i1   i2   i3
		first[i1] = [i2]
				
	Adding an item to the array assuming a variable CURRENTSIZE
		data[last] = item;
		last = (last+1)%currentsize
	
	
		
Applications of a queue
	1: Resource Management (Operating Systems) "Priority Queues = Ordered Lists" // beyond what we are doing
	2: Simulation (Queuing Systems) 
		Modeling the beahvior of another system

		perameters
			Servers
				number of servers
				transaction time
			Customers
				frequency of arrival
				patience for service
			External Factors
				time of day
				shift schedule
			Profit
				successful transactions
	
	
		for (clock = 1 ; clock <= simTime ; clock++) // simtime is how long the simulation will last
			{
				1: update server list by reducing the transaction time by 1 // Transaction time is how may ticks does if take for the server to serve a customer
				2: if non-empty, increment wait times by 1
				3: if customer arrives, increase count and add to queue
				4: if server is free & queue is not-empty, remove customer from queue and add it to the server (mark server as busy)
			}
