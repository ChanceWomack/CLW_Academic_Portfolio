Stack - Homogenous storage structure where all manipulations are done at one end called the "TOP"

LIFO = Last In, First Out
FILO = First In, Last Out

All items are put on top of the stack, on top of the one before it

"push" is the term used for adding an item to the stack // push(T)

"pop" is the deletion method for stacks // pop(T)

the value of top = the NEXT available index (highest in use index +1)

MEMBERS/METHODS TO NOTE
	int Top;
	T *data;

	pop
	push
	isEmpty
	getTop - data of top
	isFull
	getLength - index of top + 1
	printStack
	clearStack
	creation - constructor/declarations
	destroy - deconstructor
	
	
infix expressions
	the operator is in the middle of the operands
prefix expressions (polish)
	the operator is before the operands
postfix expressions (reverse polish)
	the operator is after the operands
	evaluating postfix with a stack
		rule 1: if number push on stack
		rule 2: not number, pop 2 from stack, apply operator, push result
		rule 3: when done, the result is on the stack
		
how to convert from infix to postfix

	example:	infix		(a-b) + (c-d)
			postfix		a b - c d - +
			
			infix		3*(a+b)-6*(c+d)
			postfix		3 a b + * 6 c d + *
			
			infix		(7-3)*2+6/(4-2)
			postfix		7 3 - 2 * 6 4 2 - /
